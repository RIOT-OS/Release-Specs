## Goal: Check ICMP error handling

*Note: This task requires to send some very specificly formated IPv6 packets. We
recommend to use [scapy] for the construction of those packets in those tests. A
packet can be sent e.g. using (you will require root permission for sending
using link-layer frames with `sendp()`)*

```py
sendp(Ether(dst=DST_HWADDR) / IPv6(src=SRC_IPV6, dst=DST_IPV6) / \
      UDP(dport=DST_PORT) / PAYLOAD_BYTE_STR,
      iface="tapbr0")
```

Testing procedure setup
=======================
All sub-tasks within this specification can be done using one `native` instance
of the `gnrc_networking` example. For the testing process it is assumed running

    $ ./dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup

was used to create the TAP interface (including a bridge) required for the
example. As a consequence, when talking about configuring the interface all
Linux-side configuration is assumed to be done on the bridge `tapbr0`. The
interface name might differ if you created it otherwise.

The interface and native instance are assumed to be reset (and if necessary
rebuild) for every task.

Returned packets can be verified using a sniffing tool like Wireshark or
[scapy].
